Embedded Railroad Interfacing control system.
It is a Java-based system that monitors and controls (via outputs) to a
model railroad system, in particular.
The term "model railroad" is used because the control hardware is
typically used on model railroads.

The code is written to Java 1.7 standard.
The system is two large MVC (Model-View-Controller) sub-systems,
where the physical MVC represents inputs from the railroad,
and the logical MVC decides what to do next.
This dualism kind-of matches up to a database and business logic, respectively.
